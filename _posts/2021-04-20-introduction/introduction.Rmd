At the begin of the year, I had to find a subject for this portfolio. So I immediately decided to choose something about the environmental issues. I wanted to talk about plastic pollution because it is a very important global pollution. The evolution of plastic production is very impressive. In 1950, the world produced more than 2 million tons of plastic per year. By 2015, this annual production swelled to 419 million tons.

As you certainly know, there are a lot of environmental problems like air pollution, soil pollution, water pollution, loss of biodiversity and many more. Plastic pollution is already linked to these four types of pollution. It is a big problem for our planet but it is also a problem for us. I have read that people eat, drink and inhale teaspoon of microplastic every week ! Of course we already know that could be very nocive for our health. 

Most people are aware of this pollution but I think that they don't realize all the impacts it has. On the first part of this portfolio, I have analyzed four articles on studies done on plastics and microplastics. Then, there are three analyses about researches on potential solutions to this global problem.
