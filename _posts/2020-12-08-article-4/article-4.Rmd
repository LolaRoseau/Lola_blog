## General topic

Microparticles of plastics transported by the wind.

## Procedure / What was examined

The scientists examined how the microplastics travel in the atmosphere locally and on long-distance flights. They also showed the proportion of these particles in the dust. 

- During one year, they collected microplastics from 11 national parks and wilderness areas in the western U.S.

They used a pair of bucket (one for dry weather and the other one for wet weather). The lid automatically closed thanks to a sensor. It depended on the weather.

- In the lab : some scientists counted the microplastics under their microscopes (they used dyes to separate clearly the plastics particles from other particles).

Others used the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It is a technique to mesure how the samples absorbed and emitted infrared light. Thanks to that they could differentiate plastic from other material.

## Conclusions / discovery

- In total, in the samples 4% of particles were plastic. The microplastics were from different origin : carpeting, paint, cosmetic products, camping gear, clothing…

- Wet microplastics -> heavy -> close to cities.

- Dry microplastics -> smaller and more numerous -> higher in the atmosphere, away from cities.

=> The microplastics are transported by the wind and carried far away. «More than 1,000 metric tons of microplastics fall on protected lands in the country’s western region each year».


## Remaining questions 

The future research will focus on the question : «How microplastics enter the atmosphere ?»
