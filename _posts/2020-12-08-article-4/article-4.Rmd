# Analysis about the study

## Researchers ?

## General topic

Microparticles of plastics transported by the wind.

## Procedure / What was examined

The scientists examined how microplastics travel in the atmosphere locally and long-distance. They also showed the proportion of these particles in the dust. 

- During one year, they collected microplastics from 11 national parks and wilderness areas in the western U.S. 

They used a pair of buckets (one for dry weather and the other one for wet weather). The lid automatically closed using a sensor. It was weather dependent.

- In the lab : some scientists counted the microplastics under the microscope (they used dyes to separate the plastics particles clearly from other particles).

Others used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This is a technique to measure how the samples absorbed and emitted infrared light. In this way it was possible to differentiate plastic from other materials.

## Conclusions / discovery

- In total, in the samples 4% of particles were plastic. The microplastics had different origins: carpeting, paint, cosmetic products, camping gear, clothing,…

- Wet microplastics -> heavy -> close to cities.

- Dry microplastics -> smaller and more numerous -> higher in the atmosphere, away from cities.

=> The microplastics are transported by the wind and carried far away. «More than 1,000 metric tons of microplastics fall on protected lands in the country’s western region each year ».

## Remaining questions 

The future research will focus on the question of: «How microplastics enter the atmosphere ?»
