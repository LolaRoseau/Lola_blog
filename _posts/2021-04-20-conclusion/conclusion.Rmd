As we have seen, plastic is everywhere. We have discussed the plastic masks and disposable suits used in the global Covid pandemic. Plastic feeding bottles for babies. Plastic waste of all kinds which destroys marine life. And finally, microplastics carried by the wind and released into nature. Unfortunately, there are many more articles about other situations where plastic is present and causing serious damage.

However, to end on a positive note, we have also seen that solutions will be implemented to counter this plastic pollution. I hope that within a few years we will be talking about new types of plastics that can be totally recycled, enzymes that digest plastics or cyanobacteria that will produce our bioplastics! And of course, that we will be able to say that plastic pollution is no longer a problem.

In the meantime, we must all try to limit our plastic consumption and make an effort at our own level. Each action counts for the planet and for our future generations.
