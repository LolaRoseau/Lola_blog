# Analysis about the study

## Researchers ?

The team was co-led by the scientists who engineered PETase, Professor John McGeehan, Director of the Centre for Enzyme Innovation (CEI) at the University of Portsmouth, and Dr Gregg Beckham, Senior Research Fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the US.

## Published in ? When ?

Journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 

## General topic

Association between two enzymes that digest plastic.

## Procedure / What was examined

PET is the most used plastic. The problem is that it takes a lot of time to decompose in the environment. So the scientists are trying to find a solution. 

We already know that PET-ase enzyme can digest PET plastic but it takes too much time to use it. So they needed to find an other large-scale solution for fighting plastic pollution.

At the first step, the scientists discovered another enzyme (MHET-ase) in the «natural» plastic litter. After that they made some experiments in laboratories and they found the molecular structure of the enzyme. Thanks to that they made a lot of researches on the function of this molecule and it was possible to reproduce it synthetically.  

## Conclusions / Discovery

Finally it was discovered that the combination of PET-ase and MHET-ase was a «super-enzyme». It can digest plastic particles and break them down into their building blocks six times faster than PET-ase alone.

=> This can help to reduce our plastic pollution and decrease greenhouse gases. We could also recycle our plastic indefinitely using a low energy method and retain its primary quality.
