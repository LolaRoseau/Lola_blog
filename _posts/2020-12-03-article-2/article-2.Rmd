# Analysis about the study

## Researchers ?

John Boland at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland and his colleagues.

## Published in ? When ?

 New Scientist (19/10/2020)

## Procedure / What was examined

They examined microplastics released during the process of baby formula preparation in feeding bottles made of polypropylene plastic (that’s about 69% of the feeding bottles available on the market).

1. They bought new feeding bottles which they cleaned, sterilized and let dry.

2. Then, they put them in 70°C purified water (WHO recommended this temperature for baby preparation). After that they put them in a mechanical shaker (to mimic the formula mixing process).

3. The team filtered the water and analyzed it under a microscope.

## Conclusions / Discovery

Plastic feeding bottles release an average of 4 million microplastic particles per litre into baby formula during preparation.

## Remaining questions 

They don’t know if ingesting microplastics is harmful to infant health or not.
