# Analysis about the study

## Researchers ?

Tanveer M. Adyel Department of Civil Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, Melbourne, Australia.

## Published in ? When ?

«Science» magazine Vol 369 (11/09/2020)

## General topic

The enormous accumulation of plastic waste during the Covid-19 pandemic.

## Procedure / What was examined

1. The results of lockdowns: The petroleum demand collapsed. Oil prices plummeted -> making plastic is cheaper than recycling it.

2. Personal protective equipment -> increased plastic pollution.

3. Due the lockdown -> take-away meals, grocery deliveries -> increase plastic waste.

=> This crisis caused a drastic increase in plastic consumption and also improper disposal of plastic waste.

## Conclusions / Discovery

We urgently need strict policies on plastic pollution. Without environmental protection during and after the pandemic, it is unlikely that we will achieve the UN goals.

## Remaining questions
