# Analysis about the study

## Researchers ?

Tanveer M. Adyel Department of Civil Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, Melbourne, Australia.

## Published in ? When ?

Science Mag (11/09/2020)

## Procedure / What was examined

1. The causes of lockdowns : The petroleum demand collapsed. Oil prices plummeted -> making plastic is cheaper than recycling it.
	
2. Personal protective equipment -> increased plastic pollution.
	
3. Due the lockdown -> take-out meals, delivered groceries -> increase plastic waste.
	
=> This crisis causes drastic increase in plastic consumption and also improper disposal of plastic waste.

## Conclusions / Discovery

We urgently need strict policies on plastic pollution. Without environmental protection during and after the pandemic, it is unlikely that we will achieve the UN goals.
