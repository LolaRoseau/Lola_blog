Welcome to my blog, 

My name is Lola Roseau and I’m 21 years old. 
Currently, I’m studying biology at UMons.

I started this blog during the academic year of 2020-2021. 
The first aim of this blog is to improve my English. We have to make a portfolio with articles and analyses. My English teacher is Ms Ingrid Van Lancker (I am in the group 2).
It is also a collaboration with my data science course because we need to use RStudio to manage it. 

I’m someone who is very curious about nature and everything that is alive. I always want to understand everything. My passions are : photography, traveling, animals and a lot of other things. My biggest dream is to live in Canada. 

Now that I have introduced myself a bit, I suggest you to read more of this blog. 

Good reading!
