# Analysis about the study

## Researchers ?

Professor Karl Forchhammer of the Interfaculty Institute of Microbiology and Infection Medicine and his researchers in the University of Tübingen.

## Published in ? When ?

Microbial Cell Factories and PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences) journals.

## General topic

Biological plastic produced by the cyanobacteria

## Procedure / What was examined

Scientists examined the bioplastic (polyhydroxybutyrate) produced by cyanobacteria (Synechocystis) and tried to discover a way to speed up the process. This bioplastic is a by-product of photosynthesis and so it’s sustainable and eco-friendly.

## Conclusions / Discovery

They modify the bacteria's metabolism with DNA, because they want to produce this natural plastic in huge quantities for use in industries and globally. 

After these modifications, the amount of PHB produced by the bacteria was 80% of the cell’s total mass.

The aim is now to optimise the process for a global large-scale use.
