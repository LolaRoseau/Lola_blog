# Analysis about the study

## Researchers ?

Oceana, the world's largest ocean conservation group.
Author: Dr Kimberly Warner.

## Published in ? When ?

Oceana USA website (19/11/2020)

## General topic

Damage to the US marine life due to plastic pollution.

## Procedure / What was examined

The study tried to find out which marine animals are harmed by plastic pollution in US waters and offered solutions.

## Conclusions / Discovery

- Since 2009, they found 1,792 cases of marine animals injured due to plastic (entangled, injured when swallowing it, strangled, drowned,…).

- 88% of them were threatened or endangered. The study concerns about 40 species including Hawaiian monk seals, Florida manatees, Steller sea lions and all six species of sea turtle found in the US.

- The researchers are sure that the true numbers are definitely worse. 

- Plastic pollution is one of several human-caused factors endangering the planet.
-> Industries continue to increase our use of plastic. 
The US produces more single-use plastic than any other nation.

- 15 million metric tonnes of plastic enter the oceans each year.
It is going to tripe by 2040.

=> Oceana would like: 

- Companies tp reduce the amount of plastic produced and offer plastic-free alternatives. 

- Governments to investigate policies to help reduce single-use plastics.
