# Analysis about the study

## Researchers ?

Oceana, the world's largest ocean conservation group. Authored by the Dr Kimberly Warner.

## Published in ? When ?

BBC (19/11/2020)

## Procedure / What was examined

The study tried to find out which marine animals are harmed by plastic pollution in US waters and offered solutions.

## Conclusions / Discovery

- Since 2009, they found 1,792 cases of hurted marine animals due to plastic (entangled, hurt when swallowing it, strangling, drowning…).

- 88% of them are threatened or endangered. It concerns about 40 species including Hawaiian monk seals, Florida manatees, Steller sea lions and all six species of sea turtle found in the US.

- They are sure that the real numbers are definitely worst. 

- Plastic pollution is one of several human-caused factors endangering the planet.
-> Industries continues to increase our use of plastic.
US produces more sigle-use plastic than any other nation.

- 15 million metric tonnes of plastic enter the oceans each year. It is going to tripe by 2040.

=> Oceana wants that :

- The companies reduce the amount of plastic produced and offer plastic-free alternatives. 

- The government passes policies to help reduce single-use plastics.
