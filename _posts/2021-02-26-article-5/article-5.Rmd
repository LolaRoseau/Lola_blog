# Analysis about the study

## Researchers ?

Eugene Chen at Colorado State University and his colleagues 

## Published in ? When ?

Science advance (19/08/2020)

## General topic

Discovery of a new type of infinitely recyclable plastic.

## Procedure / What was examined

About 300 million tones of plastic are produced every year globally.
In the US, only 10% is recycled because it’s hard to break down (the rest is tipped into landfill, incinerated or leaked in the environment).

## Conclusions / discovery

They discovered a new type of plastic (PBTL).

**Advantages**:

- Easy to break down into its chemical building blocks (100° -> 24 hours)
- Infinitely recyclable
- Makes high-quality products (maintains its original properties)

-> Reduces the amount of plastic waste

**Disadvantage**: Needs to be separated from other types of plastic for recycling.
